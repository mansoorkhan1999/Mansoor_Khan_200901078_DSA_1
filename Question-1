"R-6.1 
What values are returned during the following series of stack operations, if
executed upon an initially empty stack? push(5), push(3), pop(), push(2),
push(8), pop(), pop(), push(9), push(1), pop(), push(7), push(6), pop(),
pop(), push(4), pop(), pop()."

                                              ****************ANSWER******************

Operations performed according to the quetion are given below:

1) Push(5):
        When stack is empty and we execute function **Push(5)** then it push 5 into the empty stack and now the top is 5.

2) Push(3):
       After Push(5) operation when we execute **Push(3) **operation then it push 3 into the stack and now the top is 3. 

3) POP():
       When **pop()** function executed then it first retrieve/fetch top value after that  delete that top value means it delete last value that push into stack means it delete 3 and now the top is 5.After pop it returns 3.

4) Push(2):
       After pop when we Push(2) then it push 2 into the stack and now the top is 2.

5) Push(8):
       After Push(2) function when we Push (8) then it append 8 into the stack and now the top is 8. Now in stack there are three values 5,2,8.

6) POP():
       When call function pop() then it fetch the top value 8 and delete the value 8. And now there are 5 and 2 are left in stack where 2 is Top.After pop() it returns 8.

7) POP():
      After Pop() again it returns 2 and now the top is 5.

8) Push(9):
      After Push(9) then it append 9 into the stack and now the top is 9. And now there is 5 and 9 in the stack.

9) Push(1):
      After Push(1) then it append 1 into the stack and now the top is 1. And now there is 5,9 and 1 values in the stack.

10) Pop():
      After pop() it delete top value 1 from stack and now there are 5 and 9 two values left in stack and 9 is top now.

11) Push(7):
      After push(7) it append 7 into the stack and now there is three values in the stack 5,9,7 and 7 is top now.

12) Push(6):
       After push(6) it append 6 into the stack and now there is four values in the stack 5,9,7,6 and 6 is top now.

13) Pop():
       When we pop from current stack which is 5,9,7,6 than it delete the top value 6 from stack.

14) Pop():
       After pop() again it delete top value 7 .

15) Push(4):
       After push(4) it append 4 in stack and now top is 4 and there are three values in stack 5,9,4.

16) Pop():
       Calling pop function it returns 4 and delete 4 from stack.

17) Pop():
      Calling pop function it returns 9 and delete 9 from stack because it is top. 


                              ======================================================

After perform all operations now there is one value left in stack which is 5 and it is top now.
