Q-8:
Suppose an initially empty queue Q has executed a total of 32 enqueue
operations, 10 first operations, and 15 dequeue operations, 5 of which
raised Empty errors that were caught and ignored. What is the current
size of Q?

==================================ANSWER===========================================
void Enqueue(Item) = insert Item to the end of the queue.

Item Dequeue = remove and return the Item at the front of the queue. 
Throw an Empty Error if the queue is empty when the operation is invoked.

Item First = return the Item at the front of the queue, do not remove it.

Like before, a dequeue operation that fails doesn't remove anything from the queue, so there are essentially 10 dequeues

First operations don't change the queue at all

Therefore we have 32-10 = 22 
(the size of the queue is 22 at that point)
